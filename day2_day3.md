# 100 Days Of Code - Day 1 

## Today's Progress

- Continued udemy course "Building Modern Web Applications with Go (Golang)" and completed overview of Go Language part.
- Learning how to structure web applications in golang.

## Thoughts

These two days were not as productive as I had expected. Course provided a good structure to teach to be an effective developer. In the course, we considered reading templates from the disk would be a costly operation and therefore, implemented a cache to store templates. As I read from Q&A part, there are some templating engines like cloudykit/jet package that can be used instead.
