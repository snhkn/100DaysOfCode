# 100 Days Of Code - Day 1 

## Today's Progress

- Completed the "Go: The Complete Developer's Guide (Golang)" course on Udemy.
- Started new udemy course "Building Modern Web Applications with Go (Golang)" and completed overview of Go Language part.
- Solved 2 coding challenges on udemyCourse(The Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures) with golang.
- Created new repo to record coding interview prep.

## Thoughts

Today was all about Go (Golang). I started learning it a few days ago, and I've covered its main concepts. However, I lack practical experience to apply what I've learned. I searched for beginner-friendly project ideas but couldn't settle on one. Instead, I decided to tackle coding challenges in Go. Writing unit tests in Go was surprisingly straightforward, and I enjoyed that aspect! Looking forward to gaining more hands-on experience and hopefully finding a beginner-friendly project to work on.
